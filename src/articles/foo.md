It's about time... 

After three long days of trial and error I finally understand some of the in's and out's of Ruby and Linux.
I have to say its quite satisfying using the command line to get into what I previously thought was the nitty-gritty of computing.
Growing up in a Windows environment I've always been accustomed to a GUI for *everything*.

The whole point to this is to have a home for my domain(s), and a place for me to get on my box and rant about having to support IE7 by day and hack on Ruby projects by night.

I decided to build it using [toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto), a very minimalist blog engine built on top of Rack.
The ability to write all my posts in my favorite editor in Markdown and store them in .txt files intrigued me, and I have to say its quite enjoyable.

It's time for me to go now, you can follow my journies here on the blog, or using [twitter](http://twitter.com/jeffboek).
